# SQL Project and Visualization

## Project Overview

This project aims to solidify my understanding of SQL fundamentals and data visualization. I participated in the YTU Data Science Community "SQL Temel Bootcamp", where I learned the basics of SQL. As part of the program, I completed a final project to earn my certificate. However, I wanted to deepen my knowledge further, so I started writing my own queries and visualizing the results.

## Tools & Technologies Used

* Database: Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)

* SQL Connector: pyodbc

* Programming Language: Python

* Visualization Libraries: seaborn, matplotlib

*Development Environment: VS Code

## Project Workflow

* I wrote SQL queries in Microsoft SQL Server.

* I established a secure connection between MSSQL and VS Code using the pyodbc library.

* To enhance security, I implemented an interactive connection interface where users can enter their own server name and database name.

* After successfully fetching the query results, I visualized the data using seaborn and matplotlib.

* The dataset used in this project contains shipping and sales-related information.

### Queries from Bootcamp Final Project

* Retrieve all customers from the Sales.Customers table who are from the UK, USA, or France. How many customers are there in total?

* Get the number of products in each category using the Production.Products and Production.Categories tables. Which category has the highest number of products?

* Analyze total sales in Brazil by city. Which city has the highest revenue?

* For each order, determine the total number of items sold. Which order had the highest quantity, and which customer placed it?

* Identify the top 3 countries with the highest sales for the years 2007 and 2008.

### My Own Project Queries

* Identify the most sold product in 2018.

* Perform a 3-month sales analysis for Product HCQDE in 2008.

* The company wants to reward its most loyal customer. Find the customer with the most orders in the last month and offer a discount.

## Conclusion

Through this project, I strengthened my SQL skills and learned how to integrate Python for data visualization. Establishing a connection between MSSQL and VS Code allowed me to create dynamic queries, while seaborn and matplotlib helped transform raw data into meaningful insights. This project is just the beginning of my journey, and I plan to explore more advanced topics in SQL and data analytics.

By applying the knowledge I gained, I have opened new doors for myself in data science and data analysis. SQL has helped me improve my ability to understand and interpret data, making me more confident in working with complex dat
